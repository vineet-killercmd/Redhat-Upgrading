# A shell script that upgrades Python 2 files to Python 3 using 2to3, and logging the process for traceability.
# Step-by-step commands to run on the terminal/command line.

# Navigate to the correct folder where your Python files are stored
ls
cd downnloads

# List all .py files in the directory
ls *.py

# Run 2to3 (which is already installed on any python version before 3.11) directly for quick testing of all the files.
2to3 -f all .

# Files which require the upgrade from python2 to python3 version, run the following command for .py file to successfully upgrade it. 
# Consider the uno.py as the sample file. -w flag applies the changes to the file.
2to3 -f all -w uno.py

# Create a script file and use the nano editor to write the file.
touch update_py2_to_py3.zsh
nano update_py2_to_py3.zsh

#Paste the following script inside update_py2_to_py3.zsh and save it:
LOGFILE="upgrade_log.txt"
TIMESTAMP=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
echo "[$TIMESTAMP] Script run by $USER in $PWD" >> "$LOGFILE"
2to3 -w -f all . 2>&1 | tee -a "$LOGFILE"

# Make this script executable
chmod +x update_py2_to_py3.zsh

# Run the script
./update_py2_to_py3.zsh

# Check the log file
cat upgrade_log.txt
